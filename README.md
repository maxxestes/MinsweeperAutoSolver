# MinsweeperAutoSolver
 This small project creates a 16x16 valid minesweeper board based off of a random seed and solves it after being given a starting point and information around it.
 The project is able to utilize certain logical aspects of the game past "if there is one unknown space around me and I'm missing one bomb, that space is a bomb".
 It doesn't have the ability to utilize the bombs remaining in niche cases where it's required to perform logical analysis but other than those few cases,
 the program is able to get all boards to completion or non-guarentee situations 100% of the time.
